Put the .py script in the same folder than your MSU folders.
The MSU folders must ONLY contains the .pcm files.
Delete / save elsewhere the other files.
Run the script. It will select a track in a random folder each time, then
copy them in a new folder named with the date and time, DD/MM/YY format.
Finally, copy your .sfc file in the newly generated folder, and rename it
after the folder name.
Enjoy your run

--------------------------
Future upgrades I want to make :
- write tracks names in a log file when copying it, so you can check which game does this f*cking track come from
- better files scanning so you don't have do delete files with other formats than .pcm
