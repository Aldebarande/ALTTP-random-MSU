Put the .py script in the same folder than your MSU folders.
The MSU folders must ONLY contains the .pcm files.
Delete / save elsewhere the other files. The only files that should be there are the 59 .pcm files, no more no less.
Run the script. It will select a track in a random folder each time, then
copy them in a new folder named with the date and time, DD/MM/YY format.
Finally, copy your .sfc file in the newly generated folder, and rename it
after the folder name.
In the random MSU folder, you'll find a song log txt that displays all the tracks names before being remaned.
Enjoy your run

--------------------------
Future upgrades I want to make :
- better files scanning so you don't have do delete files with other formats than .pcm
